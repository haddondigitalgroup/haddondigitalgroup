# Video showcase assets

Add MP4 files here for the "Who we build for" section (small-business themed):

- **trades.mp4** – Tradespeople, builders, construction (e.g. from Pexels: construction, builder, tradesperson)
- **cafe.mp4** – Café, restaurant, hospitality workers
- **small-business.mp4** – Small business owners, retail, high street

Or set in `.env.local`:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VIDEO_TRADES` – full URL to trades video
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VIDEO_CAFE` – full URL to café/hospitality video  
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VIDEO_SMALL_BUSINESS` – full URL to small business video

If a file is missing, the section shows a poster image instead.
